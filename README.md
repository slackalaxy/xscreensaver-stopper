# xscreensaver-stopper
Stop XScreenSaver when fullscreen is playing

Place `xscreensaver-stopper.sh` in e.g. `/usr/local` or anywhere in your `$PATH`, and `xscreensaver-stopper.desktop` in e.g. `/etc/xdg/autostart/` if you want it to autostart.

Script is from [xtendo-org](https://github.com/xtendo-org): [xscreensaver.sh](https://github.com/xtendo-org/.../blob/master/arch/xscreensaverstopper.sh), which in turn uses elements from [lightsOn.sh](https://github.com/iye/lightsOn).
